# 🚀 Citi Bike NYC Analysis: Summer vs. Winter Ridership

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes Citi Bike ridership patterns in New York City during **Summer 2023 (July) and Winter 2024 (January)**. The goal is to identify seasonal trends, peak usage times, popular stations, and differences in user behavior between casual riders and members.

Using **Tableau**, we created interactive dashboards comparing ridership trends across these two periods. The insights from this analysis can help Citi Bike optimize station distribution, bike availability, and promotions based on seasonal demand.

## 📌 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Peak Riding Hours
- **Summer:** Bike usage is highest during **morning (7-9 AM) and evening (5-7 PM) rush hours**, with an additional rise in the afternoon, likely due to leisure riders.  
- **Winter:** Peak hours remain similar, but **overall ridership is lower**, and afternoon leisure rides are less common due to colder temperatures.  

### 2️⃣ Most Popular Citi Bike Stations
- **Summer:** The most active stations are near **parks, waterfronts, and tourist areas** (e.g., Central Park, Hudson River Greenway).  
- **Winter:** The busiest stations are concentrated in **Midtown and Lower Manhattan**, indicating that ridership is more focused on **commuting** rather than recreation.  

### 3️⃣ Member vs. Casual Rider Trends
- **Summer:** Casual riders take **longer trips (29.4 min)**, likely for sightseeing, while members have shorter, more frequent rides (**13.1 min**), mainly for commuting.  
- **Winter:** Both groups ride for shorter durations, but casual riders still take longer trips (**17.8 min vs. 10.7 min for members**), possibly due to fewer leisure trips in cold weather.  

### 4️⃣ Heatmaps of High-Usage Areas
